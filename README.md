# What is Image Processing?
Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.

# Opencv
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today's systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

# Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
